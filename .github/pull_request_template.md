## Briefly explain how your solution works and how to run it

My solution initializes the first element in the array as the lowest price. Then it iterates through the array, getting the profit as the current price - known lowest price. The profit is saved if it is the highest known profit. If the current price is lower than the known lowest price, the known lowest price gets updated to the current price. After the entire array has been iterated through, it return the max profit as an integer.

I also added comments alongside my code for better explanation.

You can run my solution by going to the terminal, navigating to the folder containing my solution, running "python ./solution.py", and entering an array of numbers with spaces as delimeters to separate each number. Hopefully, my solution will print an integer showing the max profit.
